## Project details 

This was a project that my Week 8 coding partner, [Glyn Knight](https://github.com/GLYNKNIGHT) and I produced using React in 5 hours of coding. 

I am very proud of what we managed to produce in 5 hours and have therefore decided not to refactor or add to this project, as I wanted to display it as it was at the end of the Hackathon.

## Ideation and Design

- We were given a list of APIs to explore and given the limited time frame, we decided that our main priority was to find an API that was reliable, free and offered useful and easy-to-manipulate data. After a bit of digging we decided to use the AudioDB API and create a site based around the data we could get from it. 

- We then used Disney Ideation to come up with some ideas of what we could using the data from the API. we set a timer for each room (dreamer, realist, and critic) to ensure we stayed on track.

- We then created a very simple low-fidelity wireframe using miro and a component tree. This really helped us to visualise and understand our final goal.

- Our aim was to create a simple site that allowed the user to search for a band or artist and then display information about them on the page.

## Building the app and challenges.

- At this point we had only been using React for 2 weeks so some of the React fundamentals such as state, props and UseEffect were still very new to us. Prior to the hackathon I had been working through NetNinjas React course and come of the concepts I had learned here, such as conditional rendering, were very valuable during the Hackathon. 

- We managed to finish the MVP ahead of schedule and thus we were able to implement two of our stretch goals. The first stretch goal was to add CSS styling and the second was to add a feature that allowed the user to discover a random band by clicking a button.  

- It was fairly easy to implement the randomizer feature as we were able to simply refactor the UseEffect function we had created for the main search feature and also apply the same CSS stylings to it. 

- I really saw the benefits of pair programming that day as my partner and I got on really well and I felt that our skill gaps complimented each other, and thus I feel that we both had learned a lot by the end of the day, as well as feeling proud of what we achieved.

## Retrospective 

- At the end, of the day we had time for a quick retrospective where we reflected on What went well the hurdles we faces and what we would do if we had more time.

- A screenshot of this can be seen below. 
- 
- I feel that our codebase is pretty sloppy and most of the code is in the App.js file and not in separate components. But given the limited time we had, trade-offs have to be made during every hackathon and we decided to focus on the functionality of the app itself. 

- Finally, at the end of the day, we gave a quick 2-minute presentation of our app and ideation process to our peers.
